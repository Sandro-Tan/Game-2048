# 2048 Game implementation in Python 3

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game first created by Italian programmer Gabriele Cirulli. This is a Python implementation that I wrote in my spare time during summer days in 2019. 

The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to merge them to create a tile with the number 2048. 

But you may continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers!
